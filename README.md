#### About this project
The goal of this project was to investigate how different descriptions of hearing devices affected users' sound quality ratings and performance on a listening test.
   
#### About the data
Data were collected from ~20 participants with hearing loss who were tested in three sessions, with a month between each session. In each session, participants listened to sounds using hearing aids that had been described in positive, negative, or neutral terms (without knowing that the devices were actually the same in each session). The data consisted of participants' sound quality ratings and speech-in-noise test scores for each session, and participants' scores for the Big Five personality traits and their pre-existing expectations for hearing aids.
